Each of these symptoms may point to a different underlying issue, which requires a systematic approach to resolve.

Reasons Why Webroot May Not Work
--------------------------------

There are several reasons why Webroot may stop functioning correctly:

- Software corruption due to incomplete installation or update failure.
- Conflict with other antivirus or security programs.
- System file corruption or operating system issues.
- Expired or deactivated subscription.
- Windows or macOS updates causing compatibility issues.

Step-by-Step Guide to Fix Webroot Not Working
---------------------------------------------

The following steps can help you identify and fix the issue:

**Step 1: Restart Your Device**

A simple restart can often resolve minor software conflicts or system glitches.

- Save any open files and restart your computer.
- After rebooting, check if Webroot is running in the system tray.
- Try opening the program manually from the Start menu or desktop icon.

**Step 2: Check Subscription Status**

An expired or inactive license can disable Webroot's protection features.

- Open Webroot if possible and check the subscription status.
- If the software shows expired or not activated, re-enter your product keycode.
- If you're unable to launch Webroot, skip to reinstalling the program.

**Step 3: Look for Conflicts with Other Software**

Running multiple antivirus programs can create conflicts that cause Webroot to malfunction.

- Open your system settings and uninstall any other antivirus or security programs.
- Restart your computer after uninstalling conflicting software.
- Launch Webroot again to see if it starts functioning properly.

**Step 4: Update Your Operating System**

Ensure your operating system is fully up to date.

- On Windows, go to Settings > Windows Update and install available updates.
- On macOS, go to System Settings > Software Update.
- Reboot your device after installing updates, then try running Webroot.

**Step 5: Run Webroot as Administrator**

Sometimes, limited user permissions can prevent the software from launching or updating.

- Right-click on the Webroot icon and select “Run as Administrator.”
- If the software launches successfully, consider updating user permissions.

**Step 6: Manually Launch Webroot Services**

Webroot relies on background services to function.

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.
- Go to the Services tab and locate `WRCoreService` or `WRSVC`.
- If the service is stopped, right-click and choose “Start.”
- If you don’t see these services, reinstall Webroot.

**Step 7: Check for Malware Interference**

Some malware programs are designed to disable antivirus software.

- Boot your system in Safe Mode with Networking.
- Try launching Webroot in Safe Mode.
- If it runs properly, run a full scan to detect and remove malware.

**Step 8: Reinstall Webroot Software**

If the software remains unresponsive or corrupted, reinstalling may be the best solution.

**Steps to Reinstall:**

1. Uninstall Webroot using Control Panel (Windows) or drag to Trash (macOS).
2. Restart your computer after uninstallation.
3. Download the latest installer from the official Webroot website.
4. Run the installer and enter your keycode.
5. Allow the software to perform an initial scan after installation.

**Step 9: Check Firewall and Network Settings**

In some cases, network settings or firewall configurations may block Webroot’s communication with cloud servers.

- Ensure that your firewall is not blocking Webroot processes.
- Add Webroot to the allowed list of your firewall or router.
- Avoid using VPN or proxy settings while troubleshooting.

**Step 10: Review Scan and Schedule Settings**

If Webroot is installed but scans are not running:

- Open Webroot and navigate to the scan schedule settings.
- Ensure that automatic scans are enabled.
- Adjust scan frequency and timing as needed.
- Save settings and run a manual scan to test functionality.

Preventative Tips for Future Issues

To ensure Webroot continues to run smoothly, consider the following tips:

When to Seek Professional Assistance

If you’ve tried all the steps above and Webroot is still not working:

- There may be a deeper system-level issue, such as OS corruption or hidden malware.
- You may need to consult with IT support or a technician.
- Always ensure you have your keycode, purchase details, and version information before seeking help.
